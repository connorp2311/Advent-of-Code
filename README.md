# Advent of Code

## Introduction

Join me on my TypeScript journey through the [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) challenge. Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed programming puzzles.

## Prerequisites

Before diving in, ensure you have:

- Node.js
- Your favorite IDE or text editor
- A comfy place to focus
- A hot cup of tea

## Usage

### Setup

Run the following commands to set up the project:

```
npm install
npm run setup
```

### How to Run

To run a specific challenge:

```bash
npm run start -- --day=DAY --part=PART
```

Replace DAY and PART with the specific day and part you want to run.

- `DAY` should be a number between 1 and 25.
- `PART` should be a number between 1 and 2.

For example, to run day 7, part 2, the command would be:

```bash
npm run start -- --day=7 --part=2
```
